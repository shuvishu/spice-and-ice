<h2>General  Information<br />
</h2>
<h3>Customer notifications<br />
</h3>
<p>When you book a tour with Explore California, you should receive two notifications via email. The first will be a <strong>tour confirmation</strong>, which states that your tour is booked, gives you the dates of your tour, and lists all amenities included in your package. The second notification should arrive two weeks prior to the start of your tour. This will be a <strong>reminder notification</strong> and will contain your tour dates and current tour conditions, if applicable. <em>If you do not receive a confirmation within 24 hours, or the reminder notification two weeks out, contact us immediately</em>. We’ll make sure there are no problems in the system and confirm your tour.</p>
<h3>Food vouchers</h3>
<p>Some tour packages include tour vouchers. These tour vouchers allow you to participate in optional activities during a tour and are usually scheduled for downtime or as an optional choice to replace the day’s featured activity. The vouchers are only good during the tour and have no cash value, and cannot be redeemed if the tour is not taken. The tour vouchers are negotiated with 3rd party vendors. Although Explore California monitors these vendors closely, we cannot guarantee that scheduled activities will take place.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to give us a call before purchasing a tour voucher and checking on the current state of the tour. This will help us give you an updated status on any tour voucher activities.</p>
<h3>Home Delivery</h3>
<p>After registration, you will be sent a PDF trip planning document specific to your tour. In the Trip Planner we offer packing advice, places of interest along the tour route, a historical and environmental overview of the tour, a list of any required equipment for the tour that is <em>not</em> provided by Explore California, and additional resources for researching the surrounding area and points of interest included in your tour. Additional information about specific tours can be found in our FAQ section.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding your tour, please don't hesitate to contact us. The earlier you can contact us with questions the better, as we may not be able to respond right away.</p>
<h3>Food checklist</h3>
<p>As you prepare for your tour, we want to make sure that you have everything you need to fully enjoy your time in California. Having everything in place when you arrive makes it easy to sit back and enjoy all that your tour has to offer. With that in mind, we’ve prepared a small checklist to help you make sure you’re ready to go!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have you arranged for your mail/paper deliver?</li>
  <li>Are friends/family aware of your itinerary?</li>
  <li>Do you have the tickets, vouchers, or trail passes provided by Explore California?</li>
