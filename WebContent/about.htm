<h1>Who we are</h1>
    <p>Spice n Ice is a harmonious blend of traditional and contemporary sophistication. <img src="_images/who_we.jpg" alt="Looking out at the Pacific" width="350" height="265" class="articleImage" />Visually spectacular in every way, this elegant Indian restaurant is located at the lower lobby level overlooking the hotel's beautifully manicured gardens. Spice n Ice seamlessly married the traditional Indian themes with a simple palette of bespoke furnishings. </p>
    <p>The dessert station is a visual treat that teases diners throughout their meals. Vertical jalebis with three different flavours, green apple kheer or chocolate coated Indian ice cream with baileys rabdi are the finale to a grand meal. Spice n Ice offers separate dessert and tea menus or thoughtful pairings of both with teas that have been handpicked and blended exclusively for the restaurant.</p>
    <p>Spice n Ice offers a private dining room for 14 guests. Within the private dining room, two evocative and contemporary figurines, one male and one female, will be sure to charm and humour their audience. In complete contrast, other artworks within the private dining room include two large gold and silver shields that have been intricately carved in a traditional style and a series of four captivating modern figurative oils on canvas that depict a goddess. Here, cuisine and art fully merge for a truly unforgettable dining experience.</p>
    <p>The presentations of Chef Oberoi's exquisite culinary inventions are served amongst work by celebrated artist Anjolie Ela Menon. <a href="contact.htm">Join our community</a> This work has been carefully restored and sits comfortably in its new space. In addition, modern artworks compliment the restaurant in the form of oil paintings, carvings, antiques and modern sculptures.</p>
